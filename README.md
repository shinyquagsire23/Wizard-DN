This is a day/night system initially designed on Fire Red and soon to be ported to Emerald and (maybe) Ruby. The core principle in this D/N system is gradients and ease of use for the user. Instead of doing sloppy, faster masks, this D/N system uses an intelligent and fast blending system which will blend 32 bit ARGB colors with the existing colors in the palette, allowing for more natural colors depending on the time of day. In addition to the palette blending, a 144 color gradient is used to create a smooth transition between times of day. The difference is clearly visible in these two pre-rendered GIFs which were made using MEH:
